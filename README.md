# David Archuleta's Very Own Website

## (Disclaimer: This is a website for my plant named David Archuleta)

This is a website I made for a coding assessment to emphasize pure HTML/CSS/JS skills. For this project I utilized some tricks I've used in early development such as simple frameworks for CSS. In the Utilities file I have a section of different margin, padding, and text classnames to make the development of the UI easier as I work on the layout in real time.

As far as Javascript, I really wanted to create an FAQ section that a user could interact with to see the answer, so I put together an accordion using Javascript that's able to display one answer at a time.

If I were to add anything else to this project, I would love to add animations that appear as you continue to scroll down as well as a component-based Skills section, so that when you click on a specific skill you get a whole page that comes up with data related to that skill. It could absolutely be accomplished using a similar method to the faq section, just using different objects of inner HTML.
